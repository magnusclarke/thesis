We review these methods, focusing on single-{SNP} tests in genome-wide association studies. We discuss the advantages of the Bayesian approach over classical (frequentist) approaches in this setting and provide a tutorial on basic analysis steps, including practical guidelines for appropriate prior specification. We demonstrate the use of Bayesian methods for fine mapping in candidate regions, discuss meta-analyses and provide guidance for refereeing manuscripts that contain Bayesian analyses.},

	abstract = {Although many of the statistical techniques used in comparative biology were originally developed in quantitative genetics, subsequent development of comparative techniques has progressed in relative isolation. Consequently, many of the new and planned developments in comparative analysis already have well-tested solutions in quantitative genetics. In this paper, we take three recent publications that develop phylogenetic meta-analysis, either implicitly or explicitly, and show how they can be considered as quantitative genetic models. We highlight some of the difficulties with the proposed solutions, and demonstrate that standard quantitative genetic theory and software offer solutions. We also show how results from Bayesian quantitative genetics can be used to create efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for phylogenetic mixed models, thereby extending their generality to non-Gaussian data. Of particular utility is the development of multinomial models for analysing the evolution of discrete traits, and the development of multi-trait models in which traits can follow different distributions. Meta-analyses often include a nonrandom collection of species for which the full phylogenetic tree has only been partly resolved. Using missing data theory, we show how the presented models can be used to correct for nonrandom sampling and show how taxonomies and phylogenies can be combined to give a flexible framework with which to model dependence.},

	abstract = {Abstract: We tested the ability of six quantitative genetic models to explain the evolution of phenotypic means using an extensive database compiled by Gingerich. Our approach differs from past efforts in that we use explicit models of evolutionary process, with parameters estimated from contemporary populations, to analyze a large sample of divergence data on many different timescales. We show that one quantitative genetic model yields a good fit to data on phenotypic divergence across timescales ranging from a few generations to 10 million generations. The key feature of this model is a fitness optimum that moves within fixed limits. Conversely, a model of neutral evolution, models with a stationary optimum that undergoes Brownian or white noise motion, a model with a moving optimum, and a peak shift model all fail to account for the data on most or all timescales. We discuss our results within the framework of Simpson’s concept of adaptive landscapes and zones. Our analysis suggests that the underlying process causing phenotypic stasis is adaptation to an optimum that moves within an adaptive zone with stable boundaries. We discuss the implication of our results for comparative studies and phylogeny inference based on phenotypic characters.},

	abstract = {Model averaging, specifically information theoretic approaches based on Akaike’s information criterion ({IT-AIC} approaches), has had a major influence on statistical practices in the field of ecology and evolution. However, a neglected issue is that in common with most other model fitting approaches, {IT-AIC} methods are sensitive to the presence of missing observations. The commonest way of handling missing data is the complete-case analysis (the complete deletion from the dataset of cases containing any missing values). It is well-known that this results in reduced estimation precision (or reduced statistical power), biased parameter estimates; however, the implications for model selection have not been explored. Here we employ an example from behavioural ecology to illustrate how missing data can affect the conclusions drawn from model selection or based on hypothesis testing. We show how missing observations can be recovered to give accurate estimates for {IT-related} indices (e.g. {AIC} and Akaike weight) as well as parameters (and their standard errors) by utilizing ‘multiple imputation’. We use this paper to illustrate key concepts from missing data theory and as a basis for discussing available methods for handling missing data. The example is intended to serve as a practically oriented case study for behavioural ecologists deciding on how to handle missing data in their own datasets and also as a first attempt to consider the problems of conducting model selection and averaging in the presence of missing observations.},

To assess the effect of a character on diversification rates using likelihood methods requires that we be able to calculate the probability that a group of extant species would have evolved as observed, given a particular model of the character's effect. Here we describe how to calculate this probability for a phylogenetic tree and a two-state (binary) character under a simple model of evolution (the {“BiSSE”} model, binary-state speciation and extinction). The model involves six parameters, specifying two speciation rates (rate when the lineage is in state 0; rate when in state 1), two extinction rates (when in state 0; when in state 1), and two rates of character state change (from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0). Using these probability calculations, we can do maximum likelihood inference to estimate the model's parameters and perform hypothesis tests (e.g., is the rate of speciation elevated for one character state over the other?). We demonstrate the application of the method using simulated data with known parameter values.},

We characterize a diverse clade of frogs (Kaloula, Microhylidae) in the Philippine island archipelago as an example of an adaptive radiation into three primary habitat specialists or ecotypes. We use a novel phylogenetic estimate for this clade to evaluate the tempo of lineage accumulation and morphological diversification. Because species-level phylogenetic estimates for Philippine Kaloula are lacking, we employ dense population sampling to determine the appropriate evolutionary lineages for diversification analyses. We explicitly take phylogenetic uncertainty into account when calculating diversification and disparification statistics and fitting models of diversification. Following dispersal to the Philippines from Southeast Asia, Kaloula radiated rapidly into several well-supported clades. Morphological variation within Kaloula is partly explained by ecotype and accumulated at high levels during this radiation, including within ecotypes. We pinpoint an axis of morphospace related directly to climbing and digging behaviors and find patterns of phenotypic evolution suggestive of ecological opportunity with partitioning into distinct habitat specialists. We conclude by discussing the components of phenotypic diversity that are likely important in amphibian adaptive radiations.},

We apply the Bayesian skyline plot to simulated data sets and show that it correctly reconstructs demographic history under canonical scenarios. Finally, we compare the Bayesian skyline plot model to previous coalescent approaches by analyzing two real data sets (hepatitis C virus in Egypt and mitochondrial {DNA} of Beringian bison) that have been previously investigated using alternative coalescent methods. In the bison analysis, we detect a severe but previously unrecognized bottleneck, estimated to have occurred 10,000 radiocarbon years ago, which coincides with both the earliest undisputed record of large numbers of humans in Alaska and the megafaunal extinctions in North America at the beginning of the Holocene.},

The ability to measure the statistical power of these methods has become crucial to ensure that data quantity keeps pace with growing model complexity. Through simulations, we show that commonly applied model choice methods based on information criteria can have remarkably high error rates; this can be a problem because methods to estimate the uncertainty or power are not widely known or applied. Furthermore, the power of comparative methods can depend significantly on the structure of the data. We describe a Monte Carlo-based method which addresses both of these challenges, and show how this approach both quantifies and substantially reduces errors relative to information criteria. The method also produces meaningful confidence intervals for model parameters. We illustrate how the power to distinguish different models, such as varying levels of selection, varies both with number of taxa and structure of the phylogeny. We provide an open-source implementation in the pmc ({“Phylogenetic} Monte Carlo”) package for the R programming language. We hope such power analysis becomes a routine part of model comparison in comparative methods.},

The evolutionary modes commonly included in {PCMs} are Brownian motion (genetic drift) and the {Ornstein–Uhlenbeck} process (stabilizing selection), whose likelihood functions are mathematically tractable. More complicated models of evolutionary modes, such as branch-specific directional selection, have not been used because calculations of likelihood and parameter estimates in the maximum-likelihood framework are not straightforward. To solve this problem, we introduced a population genetics framework into a {PCM}, and here, we present a flexible and comprehensive framework for estimating evolutionary parameters through simulation-based likelihood computations. The method does not require analytic likelihood computations, and evolutionary models can be used as long as simulation is possible. Our approach has many advantages: it incorporates different evolutionary modes for phenotypes into phylogeny, it takes intraspecific variation into account, it evaluates full likelihood instead of using summary statistics, and it can be used to estimate ancestral traits. We present a successful application of the method to the evolution of brain size in primates. Our method can be easily implemented in more computationally effective frameworks such as approximate Bayesian computation ({ABC)}, which will enhance the use of computationally intensive methods in the study of phenotypic evolution.},

A recent surge in the availability of well-sampled molecular phylogenies has stimulated phylogenetic approaches to understanding ecological processes at large geographical scales and through macroevolutionary time. We stress that {PNC} is a pattern, not a process, and is found only in some traits and some lineages. At the simplest level, a pattern of {PNC} is an inevitable consequence of evolution – descent with modification and divergence of lineages – but several intrinsic causes, including physicochemical, developmental and genetic constraints, can lead directly to a marked pattern of {PNC.} A pattern of {PNC} can also be caused indirectly, as a by-product of other causes, such as extinction, dispersal limitation, competition and predation. Recognition of patterns of {PNC} can contribute to understanding macroevolutionary processes: for example, release from constraint in traits has been hypothesized to trigger adaptive radiations such as that of the angiosperms. Given the multiple causes of patterns of {PNC}, tests should address explicit questions about hypothesized processes. We conclude that {PNC} is a scientifically useful concept with applications to the practice of ecological research.},

Currently, producing such trees when genetic data or phenotypic characters for some tips are missing generally involves assigning missing species to the root of their most exclusive clade, essentially grafting them onto existing and static topologies as polytomies. * We describe an R package, {‘PASTIS’}, that enables a two-stage Bayesian method using {MrBayes} version 3.2 (or higher) to incorporate lineages lacking genetic data at the tree inference stage. The inputs include a consensus topology, a set of taxonomic statements (e.g. placing species in genera and aligning some genera with each other or placing subspecies within species) and user-defined priors on edge lengths and topologies. {PASTIS} produces input files for execution in {MrBayes} that will produce a posterior distribution of complete ultrametric trees that captures uncertainty under a homogeneous birth-death prior model of diversification and placement constraints. If the age distribution of a focal node is known (e.g. from fossils), the ultrametric tree distribution can be converted to a set of dated trees. We also provide functions to visualize the placement of missing taxa in the posterior distribution. * The {PASTIS} approach is not limited to the level of species and could equally be applied to higher or lower levels of organization (e.g. accounting for all recognized subspecies or populations within a species) given an appropriate choice of priors on branching times.},

While many researchers have begun to evaluate the effect of ancestor–descendant relationships on observed patterns using the phylogenetic comparative method, most macroecological studies only utilize the cross-sectional comparative method to ‘remove the phylogenetic history’, without considering the option of evaluating its effect without removing it. * Currently, most researchers use this method without explicitly evaluating three fundamental evolutionary assumptions of the comparative method: (i) that the phylogeny is constructed without error (which implies evaluating phylogenetic uncertainty); (ii) that more closely related species tend to show more similar characters than expected by chance (which implies evaluating the phylogenetic signal) and; (iii) that the model of the characters' evolution effectively recapitulates their history (which implies comparing the fit of several evolutionary models and evaluating the uncertainty of the estimating model parameters). * Macroecological studies will benefit from the use of the comparative method to assess the effect of phylogenetic history without removing its effect. The comparative method will also allow for the simultaneous analysis of trait evolution and its impact on diversification rates; it is important to evaluate these processes together because they are not independent. In addition, explicit evaluations of the assumptions of comparative methods using Bayesian inferences will allow researchers to quantify the uncertainty of specific evolutionary hypotheses accounting for observed macroecological patterns. * We illustrate the usefulness of the method using the phylogeny of the genus Sebastes (Pisces: Scorpaeniformes), together with data on the body size–latitudinal range relationship to estimate the effect of phylogenetic history on the observed macroecological pattern.},

Genetic constraints occur when additive genetic variance in selectively favored directions is absent (absolute constraints) or present but small (quantitative constraints). Quantitative—unlike absolute—constraints are presumed surmountable given time. This ignores that a population might become extinct before reaching the favored state, in which case demography effectively converts a quantitative into an absolute constraint. Here, we derive criteria for predicting when such conversions occur. We model the demography and evolution of populations subject to optimizing selection that experience either a single shift or a constant change in the optimum. In the single‐shift case, we consider whether a population can evolve significantly without declining or else declines temporarily while avoiding low sizes consistent with high extinction risk. We analyze when populations in constantly changing environments evolve sufficiently to ensure long‐term growth. From these, we derive formulas for critical levels of genetic variability that define demography‐caused absolute constraints. The formulas depend on estimable properties of fitness, population size, or environmental change rates. Each extends to selection on multivariate traits. Our criteria define the nearly null space of a population’s G matrix, the set of multivariate directions effectively inaccessible to it via adaptive evolution.},

In this paper we derive compact formulae for the variance of the sample mean and the mean of the sample variance for the vector ( X 1 , … , X n ) .

The key ingredient of these formulae is the correlation coefficient between two trait values randomly chosen from ( X 1 , … , X n ) . This interspecies correlation coefficient takes into account not only variation due to the random sampling of two species out of n and the stochastic nature of Brownian motion but also the uncertainty in the phylogenetic tree. The latter is modeled by a (supercritical or critical) conditioned branching process. In the critical case we modify the {Aldous–Popovic} model by assuming a proper prior for the time of origin.},

	abstract = {The widespread correspondence between phenotypic variation and environmental conditions, the “fit” of organisms to their environment, reflects the adaptive value of plant functional traits. Several processes contribute to these patterns: plasticity, ecological sorting, and adaptive evolution. This article addresses the importance of ecological sorting processes (community assembly, migration, habitat tracking, etc.) as primary causes of functional trait distributions at the local and landscape level. In relatively saturated communities, plants will establish and regenerate in environments to which they are well adapted, so their distributions, and the distributions of associated functional traits, will reflect the distribution of optimal or near‐optimal environmental conditions in space and time. The predicted evolutionary corollary of this process is that traits related to habitat occupancy, e.g., environmental tolerances, will be under stabilizing selection. This process contributes to the widely observed pattern of phylogenetic niche conservatism, i.e., ecological and phenotypic similarities of closely related species. Evidence for niche conservatism in plants is reviewed. Based on Jackson and Overpeck’s concept of the realized environment, I propose three scenarios in which a species’ distributional responses to environmental conditions will lead to a “mismatch” between its environmental tolerances and the environments it occupies, thus creating opportunities for adaptive evolution: (1) the colonization of “environmental islands” (habitats that are discontinuous in niche space) that require large adaptive shifts in tolerance of one or more environmental factors; (2) the persistence of “trailing‐edge” populations in species tracking changing climate, if barriers to dispersal of competitors prevent competitive exclusion in the deteriorating conditions; and (3) responses to changes in the realized environment in multidimensional niche space, in which species are predicted to track environmental factors for which they exhibit narrow tolerances and exhibit adaptive evolutionary response along axes where they exhibit greater niche breadth. These three scenarios provide a conceptual framework that emphasizes the role of ecological sorting processes and stabilizing selection as the context for understanding opportunities for adaptive evolution in heterogeneous and changing environments.},

A fundamental and largely unanswered question in evolutionary biology is why some clades diversify primarily in some of these components and not others. Dramatic variation in trunk vertebral numbers (14 to {\textgreater}300) among squamate reptiles coincides with different body shapes, and snake-like body shapes have evolved numerous times. However, whether increased evolutionary rates or numbers of vertebrae underlie body shape and taxonomic diversification is unknown. Using a supertree of squamates including 1375 species, and corresponding vertebral and body shape data, we show that increased rates of evolution in vertebral numbers have coincided with increased rates and disparity in body shape evolution, but not changes in rates of taxonomic diversification. We also show that the evolution of many vertebrae has not spurred or inhibited body shape or taxonomic diversification, suggesting that increased vertebral number is not a key innovation. Our findings demonstrate that lineage attributes such as the relaxation of constraints on vertebral number can facilitate the evolution of novel body shapes, but that different factors are responsible for body shape and taxonomic diversification.},

Often, however, it is unknown whether these traits evolve gradually or in punctuated bursts during speciation. Using phylogenetic data and species’ present-day trait information, we present a novel approach to assessing the mode of character change while accounting for trait-dependent speciation and extinction. Our model, {“Binary-State} Speciation and Extinction–node enhanced state shift” ({BiSSE-ness)}, estimates both the rate of change occurring along lineages and the probability of change occurring during speciation, as well as independent speciation and extinction rates for each character state. Using simulations, we found that {BiSSE-ness} is able to distinguish along-lineage and speciational change and accurately estimate the parameters associated with character change and diversification rates. We applied {BiSSE-ness} to an empirical primate data set and found evidence for along-lineage changes in primate mating systems and social behaviors, whereas shifts in habitat were associated with speciation. In cases where trait changes may be linked to the speciation process itself (e.g., niche-related traits), {BiSSE-ness} provides a suitable framework with which to simultaneously address questions regarding species diversification and character change.},

Here we develop and use new statistical methods to infer past patterns of speciation and extinction from molecular phylogenies. Specifically, we test the null hypothesis that per–lineage speciation and extinction rates have remained constant through time. Rejection of this hypothesis may provide evidence for evolutionary events such as adaptive radiations or key adaptations. In contrast to previous approaches, our methods are robust to incomplete taxon sampling and are conservative with respect to extinction. Using simulation we investigate, first, the adverse effects of failing to take incomplete sampling into account and, second, the power and reliability of our tests. When applied to published phylogenies our tests suggest that, in some cases, speciation rates have decreased through time.},

A generalized linear model ({GLM)} is presented for the analysis of comparative data, which can be used to address questions regarding the relationship between traits or between traits and environments, the rate of phenotypic evolution, the degree of phylogenetic effect, and the ancestral state of a character. Our approach thus emphasizes the similarity among evolutionary questions asked in comparative studies. We then discuss ways of specifying the sources of error involved in a comparative study (e.g., measurement error, error due to evolution along a phylogeny, error due to misspecification of a phylogeny) and show how the impact of these sources of error can be taken into account in a comparative analysis. In contrast to most existing phylogenetic comparative methods, our procedure offers substantial flexibility in the choice of microevolutionary assumptions underlying the statistical analysis, allowing researchers to choose assumptions that are most appropriate for their particular set of data and evolutionary question. In developing the approach, we also propose novel ways of incorporating within-species variation and/or measurement error into phylogenetic analyses, of estimating ancestral states, and of considering both continuous (quantitative) and categorical (qualitative or "state") characters in the same analysis.},

In this regard, phylogenetic signal must be distinguished from phylogenetic niche conservatism. Phylogenetic niche conservatism results when closely related species are more ecologically similar that would be expected based on their phylogenetic relationships; its occurrence suggests that some process is constraining divergence among closely related species. In contrast, phylogenetic signal refers to the situation in which ecological similarity between species is related to phylogenetic relatedness; this is the expected outcome of Brownian motion divergence and thus is necessary, but not sufficient, evidence for the existence of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Although many workers consider phylogenetic niche conservatism to be common, a review of case studies indicates that ecological and phylogenetic similarities often are not related. Consequently, ecologists should not assume that phylogenetic niche conservatism exists, but rather should empirically examine the extent to which it occurs.},

	abstract = {We have presented a formal model for the quantitative analysis of phylogenetic and specific effects on the distribution of trait values among species. Total trait values are divided into phylogenetic values, inherited from an ancestral species, and specific values, the result of independent evolution. This allows a quantitative assessment of the strength of the phylogenetic inertia, or burden, displayed by a character in a lineage, so that questions concerning the relative importance of phylogenetic constraints in evolution can be answered. The separation of phylogenetic from specific effects proposed here also allows phylogenetic factors to be explicitly included in cross-species comparative analyses of adaptation. This solves a long-standing problem in evolutionary comparative studies. Only species' specific values can provide information concerning the independent evolution of characters in a set of related species. Therefore, only correlations among specific values for traits may be used as evidence for adaptation in cross-species comparative analyses. The phylogenetic autocorrelation model was applied to a comparative analysis of the determinants of sexual dimorphism in weight among 44 primate species. In addition to sexual dimorphism in weight, mating system, habitat, diet, and size (weight itself) were included in the analysis. All of the traits, except diet, were substantially influenced by phylogenetic inertia. The comparative analysis of the determinants of sexual dimorphism in weight indicates that 50\\% of the variation among primate species is due to phylogeny. Size, or scaling, could account for a total of 36\\% of the variance, making it almost as important as phylogeny in determining the level of dimorphism displayed by a species. Habitat, mating system, and diet follow, accounting for minor amounts of variation. Thus, in attempting to explain why a particular modern primate species is very dimorphic compared to other primates, we would say first because its ancestor was more dimorphic than average, second because it is a relatively large species, and third because it is terrestrial, polygynous, and folivorous.},

If reliable, these methods not only provide a means of settling the debate about the geography of speciation, but also indicate that sympatric speciation is surprisingly common and that peripatric speciation is relatively rare. Similar to any phylogenetic inference, reconstructions of speciation mode are only useful if the underlying assumptions of the method are met. In this case, the key assumption is that the geographical range of both extant and ancestral species at the time of speciation can be inferred from present-day distributions. We discuss whether, and under what circumstances, such assumptions could be met. We conclude that interspecific phylogenies are unable to test alternative hypotheses concerning the geography of speciation rigorously because of the lability of geographical ranges and the lack of correlation between the role of adaptive processes and geographical mode of speciation.},

	abstract = {Abstract The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an empirical question, but general tools for detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I error rate at a nominal α= 0.05 and good power (0.8) for simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations, one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck ({OU)} model of stabilizing selection, the other based on a new model in which character evolution can accelerate or decelerate ({ACDC)} in rate (e.g., as may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum likelihood estimation of the {OU} (d) and {ACDC} (g) parameters can serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92\\% of traits exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive) and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic) effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one), which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes, branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history, or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated {OU} (25\\% of traits) and/or {ACDC} (40\\%) transformation parameter differed significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than the original better fit the data and so could be preferred for comparative analyses.},

The concept in the modern literature dates to Simpson (1944), who used ‘evolutionary inertia’ as a description of pattern in the fossil record. Wilson (1975) used ‘phylogenetic inertia’ to describe population-level or organismal properties that can affect the course of evolution in response to selection. Many current authors now view phylogenetic inertia as an alternative hypothesis to adaptation by natural selection when attempting to explain interspecific variation, covariation or lack thereof in phenotypic traits. Some phylogenetic comparative methods have been claimed to allow quantification and testing of phylogenetic inertia. Although some existing methods do allow valid tests of whether related species tend to resemble each other, which we term ‘phylogenetic signal’, this is simply pattern recognition and does not imply any underlying process. Moreover, comparative data sets generally do not include information that would allow rigorous inferences concerning causal processes underlying such patterns. The concept of phylogenetic inertia needs to be defined and studied with as much care as ‘adaptation’.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Comparative methods analyses have usually assumed that the species phenotypes are the true means for those species. In most analyses, the actual values used are means of samples of modest size. The covariances of contrasts then involve both the covariance of evolutionary changes and a fraction of the within‐species phenotypic covariance, the fraction depending on the sample size for that species. Ives et al. have shown how to analyze data in this case when the within‐species phenotypic covariances are known. The present model allows them to be unknown and to be estimated from the data. A multivariate normal statistical model is used for multiple characters in samples of finite size from species related by a known phylogeny, under the usual Brownian motion model of change and with equal within‐species phenotypic covariances. Contrasts in each character can be obtained both between individuals within a species and between species. Each contrast can be taken for all of the characters. These sets of contrasts, each the same contrast taken for different characters, are independent. The within‐set covariances are unequal and depend on the unknown true covariance matrices. An expectation‐maximization algorithm is derived for making a reduced maximum likelihood estimate of the covariances of evolutionary change and the within‐species phenotypic covariances. It is available in the Contrast program of the {PHYLIP} package. Computer simulations show that the covariances are biased when the finiteness of sample size is not taken into account and that using the present model corrects the bias. Sampling variation reduces the power of inference of covariation in evolution of different characters. An extension of this method to incorporate estimates of additive genetic covariances from a simple genetic experiment is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recently, the utility of modern phylogenetic comparative methods ({PCMs)} has been questioned because of the seemingly restrictive assumptions required by these methods. Although most comparative analyses involve traits thought to be undergoing natural or sexual selection, most {PCMs} require an assumption that the traits be evolving by less directed random processes, such as Brownian motion ({BM).} In this study, we use computer simulation to generate data under more realistic evolutionary scenarios and consider the statistical abilities of a variety of {PCMs} to estimate correlation coefficients from these data. We found that correlations estimated without taking phylogeny into account were often quite poor and never substantially better than those produced by the other tested methods. In contrast, most {PCMs} performed quite well even when their assumptions were violated. Felsenstein's independent contrasts ({FIC)} method gave the best performance in many cases, even when weak constraints had been acting throughout phenotypic evolution. When strong constraints acted in opposition to variance-generating (i.e., {BM)} forces, however, {FIC} correlation coefficients were biased in the direction of those {BM} forces. In most cases, all other {PCMs} tested (phylogenetic generalized least squares, phylogenetic mixed model, spatial autoregression, and phylogenetic eigenvector regression) yielded good statistical performance, regardless of the details of the evolutionary model used to generate the data. Actual parameter estimates given by different {PCMs} for each dataset, however, were occasionally very different from one another, suggesting that the choice among them should depend on the types of traits and evolutionary processes being considered.},

	abstract = {We lack a comprehensive understanding of evolutionary pattern and process because short-term and long-term data have rarely been combined into a single analytical framework. Here we test alternative models of phenotypic evolution using a dataset of unprecedented size and temporal span (over 8,000 data points). The data are body-size measurements taken from historical studies, the fossil record, and among-species comparative data representing mammals, squamates, and birds. By analyzing this large dataset, we identify stochastic models that can explain evolutionary patterns on both short and long timescales and reveal a remarkably consistent pattern in the timing of divergence across taxonomic groups. Even though rapid, short-term evolution often occurs in intervals shorter than 1 Myr, the changes are constrained and do not accumulate over time. Over longer intervals (1–360 Myr), this pattern of bounded evolution yields to a pattern of increasing divergence with time. The best-fitting model to explain this pattern is a model that combines rare but substantial bursts of phenotypic change with bounded fluctuations on shorter timescales. We suggest that these rare bursts reflect permanent changes in adaptive zones, whereas the short-term fluctuations represent local variations in niche optima due to restricted environmental variation within a stable adaptive zone.},

	abstract = {Adaptive radiation ({AR)} theory predicts that groups sharing the same source of ecological opportunity ({EO)} will experience deterministic species diversification and morphological evolution. Thus, deterministic ecological and morphological evolution should be correlated with deterministic patterns in the tempo and mode of speciation for groups in similar habitats and time periods. We test this hypothesis using well-sampled phylogenies of four squamate groups that colonized the New World ({NW)} in the Late Oligocene. We use both standard and coalescent models to assess species diversification, as well as likelihood models to examine morphological evolution. All squamate groups show similar early pulses of speciation, as well as diversity-dependent ecological limits on clade size at a continental scale. In contrast, processes of morphological evolution are not easily predictable and do not show similar pulses of early and rapid change. Patterns of morphological and species diversification thus appear uncoupled across these groups. This indicates that the processes that drive diversification and disparification are not mechanistically linked, even among similar groups of taxa experiencing the same sources of {EO.} It also suggests that processes of phenotypic diversification cannot be predicted solely from the existence of an {AR} or knowledge of the process of diversification.},

	abstract = {Most phylogenetically based statistical methods for the analysis of quantitative or continuously varying phenotypic traits assume that variation within species is absent or at least negligible, which is unrealistic for many traits. Within-species variation has several components. Differences among populations of the same species may represent either phylogenetic divergence or direct effects of environmental factors that differ among populations (phenotypic plasticity). Within-population variation also contributes to within-species variation and includes sampling variation, instrument-related error, low repeatability caused by fluctuations in behavioral or physiological state, variation related to age, sex, season, or time of day, and individual variation within such categories. Here we develop techniques for analyzing phylogenetically correlated data to include within-species variation, or “measurement error” as it is often termed in the statistical literature. We derive methods for (i) univariate analyses, including measurement of “phylogenetic signal,” (ii) correlation and principal components analysis for multiple traits, (iii) multiple regression, and (iv) inference of “functional relations,” such as reduced major axis ({RMA)} regression. The methods are capable of incorporating measurement error that differs for each data point (mean value for a species or population), but they can be modified for special cases in which less is known about measurement error (e.g., when one is willing to assume something about the ratio of measurement error in two traits). We show that failure to incorporate measurement error can lead to both biased and imprecise (unduly uncertain) parameter estimates. Even previous methods that are thought to account for measurement error, such as conventional {RMA} regression, can be improved by explicitly incorporating measurement error and phylogenetic correlation. We illustrate these methods with examples and simulations and provide Matlab programs.},

The extent to which independent–contrast analysis reduces type I and type {II} statistical error in comparison with cross–species analysis depends on the relative branch lengths in the phylogenetic tree: as deeper branches get relatively long, cross–species analyses have more statistical type I and type {II} error. Phylogenetic trees reconstructed from extant species, under the assumptions of a branching process with speciation (branching) and extinction rates remaining constant through time, will have relatively longer deep branches as the extinction rate increases relative to the speciation rate. We compare the statistical performance of cross–species and independent–contrast analyses with varying relative extinction rates, and conclude that cross–species comparisons have unacceptable statistical performance, particularly when extinction rates are relatively high.},

Bivariate correlations and multivariate analyses indicated two independent suites of coevolving traits, and the results were robust over a range of alternative phylogenies. The first suite consisted of strong positive correlations among twig thickness, leaf size, inflorescence length, and branch spacing (Corner's rules). Seed size and mature height were also weakly corre‐ lated with these traits. The second suite reflected aspects of sapling crown allometry, including crown size, stem diameter, and total leaf area, which appear to be related to shade tolerance. There was a weak negative correlation between sapling crown size and mavegetative ture height, but no correlation with leaf or seed size. Most correlattion were similar in magnitude for ahistorical and independent contrasts analyses, and discrepancies between these two measures were greater in traits with lower levels of convergent evolution. The evolutionary correlations among twig, leaf, seed, inflorescence, and canopy dimensions emphasize the need for integrated theories of evolution and function of these disparate traits.},

	abstract = {Comparative studies of the relationship between two phenotypes, or between a phenotype and an environment, are frequently carried out by invalid statistical methods. Most regression, correlation, and contingency table methods, including nonparametric methods, assume that the points are drawn independently from a common distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny, they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of these phenomena have been given, and limitations of previous proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence have been discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny has been proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and the branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these conditions, the phylogeny specifies a set of contrasts among species, contrasts that are statistically independent and can be used in regression or correlation studies. The considerable barriers to making practical use of this technique have been discussed.},

Although our understanding of the strength and form of selection has increased, a general understanding of the temporal dynamics of selection in nature is lacking.

Our database contains 5519 estimates of selection from 89 studies, including estimates of both direct and indirect selection as well as linear and nonlinear selection. Morphological traits and studies focused on vertebrates were well-represented, with other traits and taxonomic groups less well-represented. Overall, three major features characterize the temporal dynamics of selection. First, the strength of selection often varies considerably from year to year, although random sampling error of selection coefficients may impose bias in estimates of the magnitude of such variation. Second, changes in the direction of selection are frequent. Third, changes in the form of selection are likely common, but harder to quantify. Although few studies have identified causal mechanisms underlying temporal variation in the strength, direction and form of selection, variation in environmental conditions driven by climatic fluctuations appear to be common and important.},

Nat. 125:1–15) comparative method of phylogenetically independent contrasts for testing hypotheses about evolutionary correlations of continuous-valued characters. We simulated data along two different phylogenies, one for 15 species of plethodontid salamanders and the other for 49 species of Carnivora and ungulates. We implemented 15 different models of character evolution, 14 of which deviated from Brownian motion, which is in effect assumed by the method. The models studied included the {Ornstein–Uhlenbeck} process and punctuated equilibrium (change allowed in only one daughter at each bifurcation) both with and without trends and limits on how far phenotypes could evolve. As has been shown in several previous simulation studies, a nonphylogenetic Pearson correlation of species' mean values yielded inflated type I error rates under most models, including that of simple Brownian motion. Independent contrasts yielded acceptable type I error rates under Brownian motion (and in preliminary studies under slight deviations from this model), but they were inflated under most other models. This new result confirms the model dependence of independent contrasts. However, when branch lengths were checked and transformed, then type I error rates of independent contrasts were reduced. Moreover, the maximum observed type I error rates never exceeded twice the nominal P value at α = 0.05. In comparison, the nonphylogenetic correlation tended to yield extremely inflated (and highly variable) type I error rates. These results constitute another demonstration of the general superiority of phylogenetically based statistical methods over nonphylogenetic ones, even under extreme deviations from a Brownian motion model. These results also show the necessity of checking the assumptions of statistical comparative methods and indicate that diagnostic checks and remedial measures can substantially improve the performance of the independent contrasts method.},

	abstract = {We propose a new method to estimate and correct for phylogenetic inertia in comparative data analysis. The method, called phylogenetic eigenvector regression ({PVR)} starts by performing a principal coordinate analysis on a pairwise phylogenetic distance matrix between species. Traits under analysis are regressed on eigenvectors retained by a broken-stick model in such a way that estimated values express phylogenetic trends in data and residuals express independent evolution of each species. This partitioning is similar to that realized by the spatial autoregressive method, but the method proposed here overcomes the problem of low statistical performance that occurs with autoregressive method when phylogenetic correlation is low or when sample size is too small to detect it. Also, {PVR} is easier to perform with large samples because it is based on well-known techniques of multivariate and regression analyses. We evaluated the performance of {PVR} and compared it with the autoregressive method using real datasets and simulations. A detailed worked example using body size evolution of Carnivora mammals indicated that phylogenetic inertia in this trait is elevated and similarly estimated by both methods. In this example, Type I error at α = 0.05 of {PVR} was equal to 0.048, but an increase in the number of eigenvectors used in the regression increases the error. Also, similarity between {PVR} and the autoregressive method, defined by correlation between their residuals, decreased by overestimating the number of eigenvalues necessary to express the phylogenetic distance matrix. To evaluate the influence of cladogram topology on the distribution of eigenvalues extracted from the double-centered phylogenetic distance matrix, we analyzed 100 randomly generated cladograms (up to 100 species). Multiple linear regression of log transformed variables indicated that the number of eigenvalues extracted by the broken-stick model can be fully explained by cladogram topology. Therefore, the broken-stick model is an adequate criterion for determining the correct number of eigenvectors to be used by {PVR.} We also simulated distinct levels of phylogenetic inertia by producing a trend across 10, 25, and 50 species arranged in 'comblike' cladograms and then adding random vectors with increased residual variances around this trend. In doing so, we provide an evaluation of the performance of both methods with data generated under different evolutionary models than tested previously. The results showed that both {PVR} and autoregressive method are efficient in detecting inertia in data when sample size is relatively high (more than 25 species) and when phylogenetic inertia is high. However, {PVR} is more efficient at smaller sample sizes and when level of phylogenetic inertia is low. These conclusions were also supported by the analysis of 10 real datasets regarding body size evolution in different animal clades. We concluded that {PVR} can be a useful alternative to an autoregressive method in comparative data analysis.},

A prerequisite for the constraint hypothesis is that static allometries are hard to change. Several studies have attempted to test this hypothesis with artificial-selection experiments, but their results remain inconclusive due to various methodological issues. Here, we present results from an experiment in which we selected independently on the slope and the elevation of the allometric relationship between caudal-fin size and body size in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata). After three episodes of selection, the allometric elevation (i.e. intercept at constant slope) had diverged markedly between the lines selected to increase or decrease it, and showed a realized heritability of 50\\%. In contrast, the allometric slope remained unaffected by selection. These results suggest that the allometric elevation is more evolvable than the allometric slope, this latter representing a potential constraint on adaptive trait evolution.

	abstract = {Interspecific comparisons have played a prominent role in evolutionary biology at least since the time of Charles Darwin. Since 1985, the “comparative method” has been revitalized by new analytical techniques that use phylogenetic information and by increased availability of phytogenies (often from molecular data sets). Because species descend from common ancestors in a hierarchical fashion, related species tend to resemble each other (elephants look like elephants); therefore, cross-species data sets generally do not comprise independent and identically distributed data points. Phylogenetically based statistical methods attempt to account for this fact. Phylogenetic methods allow traditional topics in comparative and ecological physiology to be addressed with greater rigor, including the form of allometric relationships and whether physiological phenotypes vary predictably in relation to behavior, ecology or environmental characteristics, which provides evidence about adaptation. They can also address new topics, such as whether rates of physiological evolution have differed among lineages (clades), and where and when a phenotype first evolved. We present brief overviews of three phylogenetically based statistical methods: phylogenetically independent contrasts, Monte Carlo computer simulations to obtain null distributions of test statistics, and phylogenetic autocorrelation. In a new result, we show analytically how to use independent contrasts to estimate ancestral values and confidence intervals about them. These confidence intervals often exceed the range of variation observed among extant species, which points out the relatively great uncertainty inherent in such inferences. The use of phytogenies should become as common as the use of body size and scaling relationships in the analysis of physiological diversity.},

In particular, we discuss the interplay of biological deviations with deviations due to observational or measurement errors, which are also important in comparative studies based on estimated species means. We show how bias in estimated evolutionary regressions can arise from several sources, including phylogenetic inertia and either observational or biological error in the predictor variables. We show how all these biases can be estimated and corrected for in the presence of phylogenetic correlations. We present general formulas for incorporating measurement error in linear models with correlated data. We also show how alternative regression models, such as major axis and reduced major axis regression, which are often recommended when there is error in predictor variables, are strongly biased when there is biological variation in any part of the model.

However, available phylogenies often contain many incompletely resolved nodes, or nodes from which three or more branches emanate. This paper reports a generalization of Felsenstein's method that permits the analysis of incompletely resolved phylogenies. The method is general to any sort of phylogeny and, like Felsenstein's model can accommodate more than one model of evolutionary change. The method is implemented in a computer program which can make use of information on branch lengths, or, if branch length information is not available, an algorithm is used to calculate a set of branch lengths. The wider implications of the method are that it makes explicit the assumptions about unknown branching patterns and branch lengths that all comparative methods that are applied to incompletely resolved phylogenies must make.},

	abstract = {The distribution of traits within communities is thought to provide information on the evolutionary and ecological forces that structure community composition. Ecological character displacement (evolutionary divergence among populations of interacting species within a community), as well as community-wide character displacement (even dispersion of species traits within a community via species sorting), have been widely reported and are typically interpreted as evidence for interspecific competition. However, defining an appropriate null distribution with which to assess the observed distribution of traits within a community has proved controversial. Phylogenetic methods provide an alternative approach to evaluating community structure, but such methods also require an appropriate null and have typically overlooked the potential for evolutionary dynamics within communities. Here, we present a novel phylogenetic framework that uses evolutionary expectations to generate a simple null model of the expected distribution of traits among co-occurring species. Using a stochastic Brownian motion model of trait change, we illustrate that the expected community-wide dispersion of traits varies with phylogenetic tree shape. We then use data on body mass for mammals to evaluate the accuracy with which phylogeny can predict the empirical distribution of traits and find a strong correlation between predicted and observed trait distributions. We suggest that deviations from phylogenetic expectations may therefore provide a useful tool for evaluating the role of competition in shaping community structure. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approach using empirical data on body mass and a phylogeny for a small community of terrestrial mammals in Yotvata, Israel, and reveal evidence consistent with ecological and community-wide character displacement. Our method unites ecological and evolutionary approaches, and it provides a novel framework for exploring community structure.},

The most common method of comparative analysis to test for co–evolved character variation is based on a Brownian–motion model of character evolution. If we are to test for the evolution of character covariation, and we believe that characters have evolved adaptively to fill niches during an adaptive radiation, then it is appropriate to employ appropriate models for character evolution. We show here that under several models of adaptive character evolution and coevolution during an adaptive radiation, which result in closely related species being more similar to each other than to more distantly related species, cross–species analyses are statistically more appropriate than contrast analyses. If the evolution of some traits fits the Brownian–motion model, while others evolve to fill niches during an adaptive radiation, it might be necessary to identify the number of relevant niche dimensions and the modes of character evolution before deciding on appropriate statistical procedures. Alternatively, maximum–likelihood procedures might be used to determine appropriate transformations of phylogenetic branch lengths that accord with particular models of character evolution.},

Methods are presented for the estimation of phylogeny-wide means of characters, the variance-covariance structure of the components of taxon-specific means, and the mean phenotypes of ancestral taxa. These methods, which are largely an extension of maximum-likelihood techniques used in quantitative genetics, make an efficient use of the data, are unbiased by phylogenetically uninformative contributions to mean phenotypes, and take into account fully the nonindependence of data resulting from evolutionary relationships. Statistical tests are introduced for evaluating the significance of phylogenetic heritability and of correlations between traits, and expressions are given for the standard errors of ancestral mean phenotype estimates. It is argued that the covariance structure of phylogenetic effects provides a description of a macroevolutionary pattern, whereas that for the residual effects, when corrected for sampling error, is more closely related to a microevolutionary pattern.},

This change followed in large part from the realization that traditional methods of statistical analysis tacitly assumed independence of all observations, when in fact biological groups such as species are differentially related to each other according to their evolutionary history. New phylogenetically based analytical methods were then rapidly developed, incorporated into `the comparative method', and applied to many physiological, biochemical, morphological and behavioral investigations. We now review the rationale for including phylogenetic information in comparative studies and briefly discuss three methods for doing this (independent contrasts, generalized least-squares models, and Monte Carlo computer simulations). We discuss when and how to use phylogenetic information in comparative studies and provide several examples in which it has been helpful, or even crucial, to a comparative analysis. We also consider some difficulties with phylogenetically based statistical methods, and of comparative approaches in general, both practical and theoretical. It is our personal opinion that the incorporation of phylogeny information into comparative studies has been highly beneficial, not only because it can improve the reliability of statistical inferences, but also because it continually emphasizes the potential importance of past evolutionary history in determining current form and function.},

	abstract = {There are now thousands of estimates of phenotypic selection in natural populations, resulting in multiple synthetic reviews of these data. Here we consider several major lessons and limitations emerging from these syntheses, and how they may guide future studies of selection in the wild. First, we review past analyses of the patterns of directional selection. We present new meta-analyses that confirm differences in the direction and magnitude of selection for different types of traits and fitness components. Second, we describe patterns of temporal and spatial variation in directional selection, and their implications for cumulative selection and directional evolution. Meta-analyses suggest that sampling error contributes importantly to observed temporal variation in selection, and indicate that evidence for frequent temporal changes in the direction of selection in natural populations is limited. Third, we review the apparent lack of evidence for widespread stabilizing selection, and discuss biological and methodological explanations for this pattern. Finally, we describe how sampling error, statistical biases, choice of traits, fitness measures and selection metrics, environmental covariance and other factors may limit the inferences we can draw from analyses of selection coefficients. Current standardized selection metrics based on simple parametric statistical models may be inadequate for understanding patterns of non-linear selection and complex fitness surfaces. We highlight three promising areas for expanding our understanding of selection in the wild: (1) field studies of stabilizing selection, selection on physiological and behavioral traits, and the ecological causes of selection; (2) new statistical models and methods that connect phenotypic variation to population demography and selection; and (3) availability of the underlying individual-level data sets from past and future selection studies, which will allow comprehensive modeling of selection and fitness variation within and across systems, rather than meta-analyses of standardized selection metrics.},

	abstract = {Two alternative classes of comparative statistical method differ in the way that the comparative data are used to test for an association between two quantitative traits. Directional comparative methods use reconstructions of the ancestral character states to calculate the changes between ancestral and descendant conditions along the branches of the phylogenetic tree. The set of changes in two or more traits is used to test for evidence of correlated evolution. Cross-sectional techniques do not estimate changes along the branches of the tree, but rather make comparisons across the tips of a phylogeny, or between pairs of extant taxa (or between their higher nodes). These methods, then, study the association between pairs of traits representing the contemporary endpoints of evolution. The best known of the cross-sectional techniques, the species regression, simply regresses the species values of one variable onto those of another. However, it is shown here analytically that directional and cross-sectional methods, despite making very different use of the data, estimate precisely the same evolutionary parameter: the association between the changes in two variables along the branches of the phylogenetic tree. Thus, comparative statistical techniques are able to recover the historical trends of evolution, that is, the ways in which evolution has proceeded along the branches of the phylogenetic tree, from analysis of the variation among the contemporary species of a phylogeny. This means that the choice between the two alternative traditions of comparative study cannot be based upon what the different methods purport to measure, but rather must be based upon the statistical properties of particular methods. In the light of this result, it is discussed here whether there are statistical reasons to prefer some methods over others.},

For example, based on gene sequence and microsatellite data, the method has been used to choose between competing models of human demographic history as well as to infer growth rates, times of divergence, and other parameters. The method fits naturally in the Bayesian inferential framework, and a brief overview is given of the key concepts. Three main approaches to {ABC} have been developed, and these are described and compared. Although the method arose in population genetics, {ABC} is increasingly used in other fields, including epidemiology, systems biology, ecology, and agent-based modeling, and many of these applications are briefly described.},

Here, we present phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models ({PGLMMs)} that can statistically test a wide variety of phylogenetic patterns in community structure. In contrast to most current statistical approaches that rely on community metrics and randomization tests, {PGLMMs} are model-based statistics that fit observed presence/absence data to underlying hypotheses about the distributions of species among communities. We built four {PGLMMs} to address (1) phylogenetic patterns in community composition, (2) phylogenetic variation in species sensitivities to environmental gradients among communities, (3) phylogenetic repulsion in which closely related species are less likely to co-occur, and (4) trait-based variation in species sensitivities to environmental gradients. We also built a fifth {PGLMM} to test a key underlying assumption of phylogenetic community structure: that phylogenetic information serves as a surrogate for trait information about species; this model tests whether the introduction of trait information can explain all variation in species occurrences among communities, leaving no phylogenetic residual variation. We assessed the performance of these {PGLMMs} using community simulation models and show that {PGLMMs} have equal or greater statistical power than alternative approaches currently in the literature. Finally, we illustrate the {PGLMM} advantage of fitting a model to data by showing how variation in species occurrences among communities can be partitioned into phylogenetic and site-specific components, and how fitted models can be used to predict the co-occurrence of phylogenetically related species.},

This is one of several available comparative methods that maps data for phenotypic traits onto an existing phylogenetic tree (derived from independent information). Application of Felsenstein's method does not require an entirely dichotomous topology. It also does not require an assumption of gradual, clocklike character evolution, as might be modeled by Brownian motion. Almost any available information can be used to estimate branch lengths (e.g., genetic distances, divergence times estimated from the fossil record or from molecular clocks, numbers of character changes from a cladistic analysis). However, the adequacy for statistical purposes of any proposed branch lengths must be verified empirically for each phytogeny and for each character. We suggest a simple way of doing this, based on graphical analysis of plots of standardized independent contrasts versus their standard deviations (i.e., the square roots of the sums of their branch lengths). In some cases, the branch lengths and/or the values of traits being studied will require transformation. An example involving the scaling of mammalian home range area is presented. Once adequately standardized, sets of independent contrasts can be analyzed using either linear or nonlinear (multiple) regression. In all cases, however, regressions (or correlations) must be computed through the origin. We also discuss ways of correcting for body size effects and how this relates to making graphical representations of relationships of standardized independent contrasts. We close with a consideration of the types of traits that can be analyzed with independent contrasts procedures and conclude that any (continuous) trait that is inherited from ancestors is appropriate for analysis, regardless of the mechanism of inheritance (e.g., genetic or cultural).},

In semi-precocial species, chicks are reliant on the parents for feeding, but in precocial species the chicks feed themselves. Thus, where the parents are emancipated from feeding the young, we predict that there is an increased potential for brood desertion, and consequently for the divergence of mating systems. In addition, secondary sexual traits are predicted to evolve faster in groups with less demanding young. We found that precocial development not only allows rapid divergence of parental care and mating behaviours, but also promotes the rapid diversification of secondary sexual characters, most notably sexual size dimorphism ({SSD)} in body mass. Thus, less demanding offspring appear to facilitate rapid evolution of breeding systems and some sexually selected traits.},

We reviewed the literature from 1984 through 1997 for studies that estimated the strength of linear and quadratic selection in terms of standardized selection gradients or differentials on natural variation in quantitative traits for field populations. We tabulated 63 published studies of 62 species that reported over 2,500 estimates of linear or quadratic selection. More than 80\\% of the estimates were for morphological traits; there is very little data for behavioral or physiological traits. Most published selection studies were unreplicated and had sample sizes below 135 individuals, resulting in low statistical power to detect selection of the magnitude typically reported for natural populations. The absolute values of linear selection gradients {\textbar}β{\textbar} were exponentially distributed with an overall median of 0.16, suggesting that strong directional selection was uncommon. The values of {\textbar}β{\textbar} for selection on morphological and on life‐history/phenological traits were significantly different: on average, selection on morphology was stronger than selection on phenology/life history. Similarly, the values of {\textbar}β{\textbar} for selection via aspects of survival, fecundity, and mating success were significantly different: on average, selection on mating success was stronger than on survival. Comparisons of estimated linear selection gradients and differentials suggest that indirect components of phenotypic selection were usually modest relative to direct components. The absolute values of quadratic selection gradients {\textbar}γ{\textbar} were exponentially distributed with an overall median of only 0.10, suggesting that quadratic selection is typically quite weak. The distribution of γ values was symmetric about 0, providing no evidence that stabilizing selection is stronger or more common than disruptive selection in nature.},

What factors reduce total directional selection and the cumulative evolutionary responses to selection? We combine two data sets for phenotypic selection, representing more than 4,600 distinct estimates of selection from 143 studies, to evaluate the potential roles of fitness trade-offs, indirect (correlated) selection, temporally varying selection, and stabilizing selection for reducing net directional selection and cumulative responses to selection. We detected little evidence that trade-offs among different fitness components reduced total directional selection in most study systems. Comparisons of selection gradients and selection differentials suggest that correlated selection frequently reduced total selection on size but not on other types of traits. The direction of selection on a trait often changes over time in many temporally replicated studies, but these fluctuations have limited impact in reducing cumulative directional selection in most study systems. Analyses of quadratic selection gradients indicated stabilizing selection on body size in at least some studies but provided little evidence that stabilizing selection is more common than disruptive selection for most traits or study systems. Our analyses provide little evidence that fitness trade-offs, correlated selection, or stabilizing selection strongly constrains the directional selection reported for most quantitative traits.},

Orzack and Sober (2001) developed the method of controlled comparisons to make such assessments; their implementation of the method focussed on a discretely varying trait. Here, we show that the method of controlled comparisons can be viewed as a meta-method, which can be implemented in many ways. We discuss which recent methods for the comparative analysis of continuously distributed traits can generate controlled comparisons and can thereby be used to properly assess whether current adaptation and/or phylogenetic inertia have influenced a trait's evolution. The implementation of controlled comparisons is illustrated by an analysis of sex-ratio data for fig wasps. This analysis suggests that current adaptation and phylogenetic inertia influence this trait.},

It predicts the response to selection as the product of an additive genetic variance matrix and a selection gradient. The selection gradient approximates the force and direction of selection, and the genetic variance matrix quantifies the role of the genetic system in evolution. Attempts to understand the evolutionary significance of the genetic variance matrix are hampered by the fact that the majority of the methods used to characterize and compare variance matrices have not been derived in an explicit theoretical context. We use the Lande equation to derive new measures of the ability of a variance matrix to allow or constrain evolution in any direction in phenotype space. Evolvability captures the ability of a population to evolve in the direction of selection when stabilizing selection is absent. Conditional evolvability captures the ability of a population to respond to directional selection in the presence of stabilizing selection on other trait combinations. We then derive measures of character autonomy and integration from these evolvabilities. We study the properties of these measures and show how they can be used to interpret and compare variance matrices. As an illustration, we show that divergence of wing shape in the dipteran family Drosophilidae has proceeded in directions that have relatively high evolvabilities.},

They include correlated evolutionary change and trajectories of trait evolution, convergent and parallel evolution, differential rates of evolution, speciation and extinction, the order and direction of change in characters, and the nature of the evolutionary process itself—does change accumulate gradually, episodically, or in punctuational bursts. Phylogenies, in combination with information on species, contain the imprint of these historical evolutionary processes. By applying comparative methods based upon statistical models of evolution to well resolved phylogenies, it is possible to infer the historical evolutionary processes that must have existed in the past, given the patterns of diversity seen in the present. I describe a set of maximum likelihood statistical methods for inferring such processes. The methods estimate parameters of statistical models for inferring correlated evolutionary change in continuously varying characters, for detecting correlated evolution in discrete characters, for estimating rates of evolution, and for investigating the nature of the evolutionary process itself. They also anticipate the wealth of information becoming available to biological scientists from genetic studies that pin down relationships among organisms with unprecedented accuracy.},

Here, I use a novel phylogenetic comparative analysis to show that rockfish speciation is instead associated with divergence in habitat depth and depth-associated morphology, consistent with models of parapatric speciation. Using the same analysis, I find no support for alternative hypotheses that speciation involves divergence in diet or life history, or that speciation involves geographic isolation by latitude. These findings support the hypothesis that rockfishes undergo ecological speciation on an environmental gradient.},

Biologists can use these signals to tackle questions related to the evolutionary processes underlying trait evolution, estimate the ancestral state of a trait, and predict unknown trait values from those of related species (i.e. “phylogenetic modelling”). Approaches to model phylogenetic signals rely on quantitative descriptors of the structures representing the consequences of evolution on trait differences among species. * Here, we propose a novel framework to model phylogenetic signals: Phylogenetic Eigenvectors Maps ({PEM).} {PEM} are a set of eigenfunctions obtained from the structure of a phylogenetic graph, which can be a standard phylogenetic tree or a phylogenetic tree with added reticulations. These eigenfunctions depict a set of potential patterns of phenotype variation among species from the structure of the phylogenetic graph. A subset of eigenfunctions from a {PEM} is selected for the purpose of predicting the phenotypic values of traits for species that are represented in a tree, but for which trait data are otherwise lacking. This paper introduces a comprehensive view and the computational details of the {PEM} framework (with calculation examples), a simulation study to demonstrate the ability of {PEM} to predict trait values, and four real data examples of the use of the framework. * Simulation results show that {PEM} are robust in representing phylogenetic signal and in estimating trait values. * The method also performed well when applied to the real world data: prediction coefficient were high (0.76-0.88) and no notable model biases were found. * Phylogenetic modelling using {PEM} is shown to be a useful methodological asset to disciplines such as ecology, ecophysiology, ecotoxicology, pharmaceutical botany, among others, which can benefit from estimating trait values that are laborious and often expensive to {obtain.This} article is protected by copyright.

One proposed explanation for this pattern is ecological opportunity, whereby an initial abundance of resources and lack of potential competitors facilitate rapid diversification. This model predicts density-dependent declines in diversification rates, but has not been formally tested in any species-level radiation. Here we develop a new conceptual framework that distinguishes density dependence from alternative processes that also produce temporally declining diversification, and we demonstrate this approach using a new phylogeny of North American Dendroica wood warblers. We show that explosive lineage accumulation early in the history of this avian radiation is best explained by a density-dependent diversification process. Our results suggest that the tempo of wood warbler diversification was mediated by ecological interactions among species and that lineage and ecological diversification in this group are coupled, as predicted under the ecological opportunity model.},

	abstract = {Abstract Maximum likelihood is a potentially powerful approach for investigating the tempo of diversification using molecular phylogenetic data. Likelihood methods distinguish between rate-constant and rate-variable models of diversification by fitting birth-death models to phylogenetic data. Because model selection in this context is a test of the null hypothesis that diversification rates have been constant over time, strategies for selecting best-fit models must minimize Type I error rates while retaining power to detect rate variation when it is present. Here I examine model selection, parameter estimation, and power to reject the null hypothesis using likelihood models based on the birth-death process. The Akaike information criterion ({AIC)} has often been used to select among diversification models; however, I find that selecting models based on the lowest {AIC} score leads to a dramatic inflation of the Type I error rate. When appropriately corrected to reduce Type I error rates, the birth-death likelihood approach performs as well or better than the widely used gamma statistic, at least when diversification rates have shifted abruptly over time. Analyses of datasets simulated under a range of rate-variable diversification scenarios indicate that the birth-death likelihood method has much greater power to detect variation in diversification rates when extinction is present. Furthermore, this method appears to be the only approach available that can distinguish between a temporal increase in diversification rates and a rate-constant model with nonzero extinction. I illustrate use of the method by analyzing a published phylogeny for Australian agamid lizards.},

Trait variation is therefore a function of both the phylogenetic and spatial context of species. Here we introduce a method that, within a single framework, estimates the relative roles of spatial and phylogenetic variations in comparative data. The approach requires traits measured across phylogenetic units, e.g. species, the spatial occurrences of those units and a phylogeny connecting them. The method modifies the expected variance of phylogenetically independent contrasts to include both spatial and phylogenetic effects. We illustrate this approach by analysing cross-species variation in body mass, geographical range size and species-typical environmental temperature in three orders of mammals (carnivores, artiodactyls and primates). These species attributes contain highly disparate levels of phylogenetic and spatial signals, with the strongest phylogenetic autocorrelation in body size and spatial dependence in environmental temperatures and geographical range size showing mixed effects. The proposed method successfully captures these differences and in its simplest form estimates a single parameter that quantifies the relative effects of space and phylogeny. We discuss how the method may be extended to explore a range of models of evolution and spatial dependence.},

This paper presents a model of adaptive evolution on a macroevolutionary time scale that includes the maintenance of traits at adaptive optima by stabilizing selection as the dominant evolutionary force. Interspecific variation is treated as variation in the position of adaptive optima. The model illustrates how phylogenetic constraints not only lead to correlations between phylogenetically related species, but also to imperfect adaptations. From this model, a statistical comparative method is derived that can be used to estimate the effect of a selective factor on adaptive optima in a way that would be consistent with an optimality study of adaptation to this factor. The method is illustrated with an analysis of dental evolution in fossil horses. The use of comparative methods to study evolutionary trends is also discussed.},

All traits develop clines shifting in space, some of which may be in a direction opposite to univariate predictions, and the species tracks its environmental optimum with a constant lag. We provide analytical expressions for the local density and average trait values. A species can sustain faster environmental shifts, develop a wider range and greater local adaptation when spatial environmental variation is low (generating low migration load) and multitrait adaptive potential is high. These conditions are favoured when nonlinear (stabilising) selection is weak in the phenotypic direction of the change in optimum, and genetic variation is high in the phenotypic direction of the selection gradient.},

I review hypotheses of evolutionary constraint (or restraint), and suggest that although constraints on individual characters or character complexes may often reside in the structure or paucity of genetic variation, organism-wide stasis, as described by paleontologists, might better be explained by a hypothesis of ephemeral divergence, according to which the spatial or temporal divergence of populations is often short-lived because of interbreeding with nondivergent populations. Among the many consequences of acknowledging evolutionary constraints, community ecology is being transformed as it takes into account phylogenetic niche conservatism and the strong imprint of deep history.},

The residual covariance is parametrized using the tree-distance between sampling units. When observations are modeled using an {Ornstein–Uhlenbeck} ({OU)} process along the tree, the autocorrelation between two tips decreases exponentially with their tree distance. These models are most often applied in evolutionary biology, when tips represent biological species and the {OU} process parameters represent the strength and direction of natural selection. For these models, we show that the mean is not microergodic: no estimator can ever be consistent for this parameter and provide a lower bound for the variance of its {MLE.} For covariance parameters, we give a general sufficient condition ensuring microergodicity. This condition suggests that some parameters may not be estimated at the same rate as others. We show that, indeed, maximum likelihood estimators of the autocorrelation parameter converge at a slower rate than that of generally microergodic parameters. We showed this theoretically in a symmetric tree asymptotic framework and through simulations on a large real tree comprising 4507 mammal species.},

For a few of the simpler models, the calculation of the likelihood of an evolutionary tree is outlined. For these models, the maximum likelihood tree will be the same as the “most parsimonious” (or minimum-steps) tree if the probability of change during the evolution of the group is assumed a priori to be very small. However, most sets of data require too many assumed state changes per character to be compatible with this assumption. Farris (1973) has argued that maximum likelihood and parsimony methods are identical under a much less restrictive set of assumptions. It is argued that the present methods are preferable to his, and a counterexample to his argument is presented. An algorithm which enables rapid calculation of the likelihood of a phylogeny is described.},

	abstract = {Traits do not evolve independently. To understand how trait changes under selection might constrain adaptive changes, phenotypic and genetic correlations are typically considered within species, but these capture constraints across a few generations rather than evolutionary time. For longer-term constraints, comparisons are needed across species but associations may arise because of correlated selection pressures rather than genetic interactions. Implementing a unique approach, we use known patterns of selection to separate likely trait correlations arising due to correlated selection from those reflecting genetic constraints. We examined the evolution of stress resistance in {\textgreater}90 Drosophila species adapted to a range of environments, while controlling for phylogeny. Initially we examined the role of climate and phylogeny in shaping the evolution of starvation and body size, two traits previously not examined in this context. Following correction for phylogeny only a weak relationship between climate and starvation resistance was detected, while all of the variation in the relationship between body size and climate could be attributed to phylogeny. Species were divided into three environmental groups (hot and dry, hot and wet, cold) with the expectation that, if genetic correlations underpin trait correlations, these would persist irrespective of the environment, whereas selection-driven evolution should produce correlations dependent on the environment. We found positive associations between most traits in hot and dry environments coupled with high trait means. In contrast few trait correlations were observed in hot/wet and cold environments. These results suggest trait associations are primarily driven by correlated selection rather than genetic interactions, highlighting that such interactions are unlikely to limit evolution of stress resistance.},

One such approach is to quantify phylogenetic signal to determine how trait variation is correlated with the phylogenetic relatedness of species. When phylogenetic signal is high, closely related species exhibit similar traits, and this biological similarity decreases as the evolutionary distance between species increases. Here, we first review the concept of phylogenetic signal and suggest how to measure and interpret phylogenetic signal in species traits. Second, we quantified phylogenetic signal in primates for 31 variables, including body mass, brain size, life-history, sexual selection, social organization, diet, activity budget, ranging patterns and climatic variables. We found that phylogenetic signal varies extensively across and even within trait categories. The highest values are exhibited by brain size and body mass, moderate values are found in the degree of territoriality and canine size dimorphism, while low values are displayed by most of the remaining variables. Our results have important implications for the evolution of behaviour and ecology in primates and other vertebrates.},

	abstract = {Comparisons among species have been a standard tool in animal physiology to understand how organisms function and adapt to their surrounding environment. During the last two decades, conceptual and methodological advances from different fields, including evolutionary biology and systematics, have revolutionized the way comparative analyses are performed, resulting in the advent of modern phylogenetic statistical methods. This development stems from the realization that conventional analytical methods assume that observations are statistically independent, which is not the case for comparative data because species often resemble each other due to shared ancestry. By taking evolutionary history explicitly into consideration, phylogenetic statistical methods can account for the confounding effects of shared ancestry in interspecific comparisons, improving the reliability of standard approaches such as regressions or correlations in comparative analyses. Importantly, these methods have also enabled researchers to address entirely new evolutionary questions, such as the historical sequence of events that resulted in current patterns of form and function, which can only be studied with a phylogenetic perspective. Here, we provide an overview of phylogenetic approaches and their importance for studying the evolution of physiological processes and mechanisms. We discuss the conceptual framework underlying these methods, and explain when and how phylogenetic information should be employed. We then outline the difficulties and limitations inherent to comparative approaches and discuss potential problems researchers may encounter when designing a comparative study. These issues are illustrated with examples from the literature in which the incorporation of phylogenetic information has been useful, or even crucial, for inferences on how species evolve and adapt to their surrounding environment. © 2012 American Physiological Society.

Allometric exponents may therefore be hard to change and act as constraints on the independent evolution of traits. In apparent contradiction to this, many empirical studies have concluded that static allometries are evolvable. Many of these studies have been based, however, on a broad definition of allometry that includes any monotonic shape change with size, and do not falsify the hypothesis of constrained narrow-sense allometry. Here, we present the first phylogenetic comparative study of narrow-sense allometric exponents based on a reanalysis of data on eye span and body size in stalk-eyed flies (Diopsidae). Consistent with a role in sexual selection, we found strong evidence that male slopes were tracking “optima” based on sexual dimorphism and relative male trait size. This tracking was slow, however, with estimated times of 2–3 million years for adaptation to exceed ancestral influence on the trait. Our results are therefore consistent with adaptive evolution on million-year time scales, but cannot rule out that static allometry may act as a constraint on eye-span adaptation at shorter time scales.},

	abstract = {The general maximum likelihood approach to the statistical estimation of phylogenies is outlined, for data in which there are a number of discrete states for each character. The details of the maximum likelihood method will depend on the details of the probabilistic model of evolution assumed. There are a very large number of possible models of evolution. For a few of the simpler models, the calculation of the likelihood of an evolutionary tree is outlined. For these models, the maximum likelihood tree will be the same as the “most parsimonious” (or minimum-steps) tree if the probability of change during the evolution of the group is assumed a priori to be very small. However, most sets of data require too many assumed state changes per character to be compatible with this assumption. Farris (1973) has argued that maximum likelihood and parsimony methods are identical under a much less restrictive set of assumptions. It is argued that the present methods are preferable to his, and a counterexample to his argument is presented. An algorithm which enables rapid calculation of the likelihood of a phylogeny is described.},

The methods are applied assuming that only the phylogeny, and the function-valued traits of taxa at its tips are known.

The residual covariance is parametrized using the tree-distance between sampling units. When observations are modeled using an {Ornstein–Uhlenbeck} ({OU)} process along the tree, the autocorrelation between two tips decreases exponentially with their tree distance. These models are most often applied in evolutionary biology, when tips represent biological species and the {OU} process parameters represent the strength and direction of natural selection. For these models, we show that the mean is not microergodic: no estimator can ever be consistent for this parameter and provide a lower bound for the variance of its {MLE.} For covariance parameters, we give a general sufficient condition ensuring microergodicity. This condition suggests that some parameters may not be estimated at the same rate as others. We show that, indeed, maximum likelihood estimators of the autocorrelation parameter converge at a slower rate than that of generally microergodic parameters. We showed this theoretically in a symmetric tree asymptotic framework and through simulations on a large real tree comprising 4507 mammal species.},

Here we discuss some fundamental concepts and techniques of model selection in the context of phylogenetics. We start by reviewing different aspects of the selection of substitution models in phylogenetics from a theoretical, philosophical and practical point of view, and summarize this comparison in table format. We argue that the most commonly implemented model selection approach, the hierarchical likelihood ratio test, is not the optimal strategy for model selection in phylogenetics, and that approaches like the Akaike Information Criterion ({AIC)} and Bayesian methods offer important advantages. In particular, the latter two methods are able to simultaneously compare multiple nested or nonnested models, assess model selection uncertainty, and allow for the estimation of phylogenies and model parameters using all available models (model-averaged inference or multimodel inference). We also describe how the relative importance of the different parameters included in substitution models can be depicted. To illustrate some of these points, we have applied {AIC-based} model averaging to 37 mitochondrial {DNA} sequences from the subgenus Ohomopterus (genus Carabus) ground beetles described by Sota and Vogler (2001).},

Consequently, many of the new and planned developments in comparative analysis already have well-tested solutions in quantitative genetics. In this paper, we take three recent publications that develop phylogenetic meta-analysis, either implicitly or explicitly, and show how they can be considered as quantitative genetic models. We highlight some of the difficulties with the proposed solutions, and demonstrate that standard quantitative genetic theory and software offer solutions. We also show how results from Bayesian quantitative genetics can be used to create efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for phylogenetic mixed models, thereby extending their generality to non-Gaussian data. Of particular utility is the development of multinomial models for analysing the evolution of discrete traits, and the development of multi-trait models in which traits can follow different distributions. Meta-analyses often include a nonrandom collection of species for which the full phylogenetic tree has only been partly resolved. Using missing data theory, we show how the presented models can be used to correct for nonrandom sampling and show how taxonomies and phylogenies can be combined to give a flexible framework with which to model dependence.},

Currently, producing such trees when genetic data or phenotypic characters for some tips are missing generally involves assigning missing species to the root of their most exclusive clade, essentially grafting them onto existing and static topologies as polytomies. * We describe an R package, {‘PASTIS’}, that enables a two-stage Bayesian method using {MrBayes} version 3.2 (or higher) to incorporate lineages lacking genetic data at the tree inference stage. The inputs include a consensus topology, a set of taxonomic statements (e.g. placing species in genera and aligning some genera with each other or placing subspecies within species) and user-defined priors on edge lengths and topologies. {PASTIS} produces input files for execution in {MrBayes} that will produce a posterior distribution of complete ultrametric trees that captures uncertainty under a homogeneous birth-death prior model of diversification and placement constraints. If the age distribution of a focal node is known (e.g. from fossils), the ultrametric tree distribution can be converted to a set of dated trees. We also provide functions to visualize the placement of missing taxa in the posterior distribution. * The {PASTIS} approach is not limited to the level of species and could equally be applied to higher or lower levels of organization (e.g. accounting for all recognized subspecies or populations within a species) given an appropriate choice of priors on branching times.},

Phylogenetic comparative methods initially aimed at accounting for or removing the effects of phylogenetic signal in the analysis of biological traits. However, recent approaches have shown that considerable information can be gathered from the study of the phylogenetic signal. In particular, close examination of phylogenetic structures can unveil interesting evolutionary patterns. For this purpose, we developed the package adephylo that provides tools for quantifying and describing the phylogenetic structures of biological traits. adephylo implements tests of phylogenetic signal, phylogenetic distances and proximities, and novel methods for describing further univariate and multivariate phylogenetic structures. These tools open up new perspectives in the analysis of evolutionary comparative data.

Our database contains 5519 estimates of selection from 89 studies, including estimates of both direct and indirect selection as well as linear and nonlinear selection. Morphological traits and studies focused on vertebrates were well-represented, with other traits and taxonomic groups less well-represented. Overall, three major features characterize the temporal dynamics of selection. First, the strength of selection often varies considerably from year to year, although random sampling error of selection coefficients may impose bias in estimates of the magnitude of such variation. Second, changes in the direction of selection are frequent. Third, changes in the form of selection are likely common, but harder to quantify. Although few studies have identified causal mechanisms underlying temporal variation in the strength, direction and form of selection, variation in environmental conditions driven by climatic fluctuations appear to be common and important.},

One proposed explanation for this pattern is ecological opportunity, whereby an initial abundance of resources and lack of potential competitors facilitate rapid diversification. This model predicts density-dependent declines in diversification rates, but has not been formally tested in any species-level radiation. Here we develop a new conceptual framework that distinguishes density dependence from alternative processes that also produce temporally declining diversification, and we demonstrate this approach using a new phylogeny of North American Dendroica wood warblers. We show that explosive lineage accumulation early in the history of this avian radiation is best explained by a density-dependent diversification process. Our results suggest that the tempo of wood warbler diversification was mediated by ecological interactions among species and that lineage and ecological diversification in this group are coupled, as predicted under the ecological opportunity model.},

	abstract = {Abstract Flying animals may experience a selective constraint on gut volume because the energetic cost of flight increases and maneuverability decreases with greater digesta load. The small intestine is the primary site of absorption of most nutrients (e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, fat) in both birds and mammals. Therefore, we used a phylogenetically informed approach to compare small intestine morphometric measurements of birds with those of nonflying mammals and to test for effects of diet within each clade. We also compared the fit of nonphylogenetic and phylogenetic models to test for phylogenetic signal after accounting for effects of body mass, clade, and/or diet. We provide a new {MATLAB} program (Regressionv2.m) that facilitates a flexible model‐fitting approach in comparative studies. As compared with nonflying mammals, birds had 51\\% less nominal small intestine surface area (area of a smooth bore tube) and 32\\% less volume. For animals {\textless}365 g in body mass, birds also had significantly shorter small intestines (20\\%–33\\% shorter, depending on body mass). Diet was also a significant factor explaining variation in small intestine nominal surface area of both birds and nonflying mammals, small intestine mass of mammals, and small intestine volume of both birds and nonflying mammals. On the basis of the phylogenetic trees used in our analyses, small intestine length and nominal surface area exhibited statistically significant phylogenetic signal in birds but not in mammals. Thus, for birds, related species tended to be similar in small intestine length and nominal surface area, even after accounting for relations with body mass and diet. A reduced small intestine in birds may decrease the capacity for breakdown and active absorption of nutrients. Birds do not seem to compensate for reduced digestive and absorptive capacity via a longer gut retention time of food, but we found some evidence that birds have an increased mucosal surface area via a greater villus area, although not enough to compensate for reduced nominal surface area. We predict that without increased rate of enzyme hydrolysis and/or mediated transport and without increased passive absorption of water‐soluble nutrients, birds may operate with a reduced digestive capacity, compared with that of nonflying mammals, to meet an increase in metabolic needs (i.e., a reduced spare capacity).},

	abstract = {Time-calibrated molecular phylogenies provide a valuable window into the tempo and mode of species diversification, especially for the large number of groups that lack adequate fossil records. Molecular phylogenetic data frequently suggest an initial “explosive speciation” phase, leading to widespread speculation that ecological niche-filling processes might govern the dynamics of species diversification during evolutionary radiations. However, these patterns are difficult to reconcile with the fossil record. The fossil record strongly suggests that extinction rates have been high relative to speciation rates, but such elevated background extinction should erase the signal of early, rapid speciation from molecular phylogenies. For this reason, extinction rates in molecular phylogenies are frequently estimated as zero under the widely used birth–death model. Here, I construct a simple model that combines phylogenetically patterned extinction with pulsed turnover dynamics and constant diversity through time. Using approximate Bayesian methods, I show that heritable extinction can easily explain the phenomenon of explosive early diversification, even when net diversification rates are equal to zero. Several assumptions of the model are more consistent with both the fossil record and neontological data than the standard birth–death model and it may thus represent a viable alternative interpretation of phylogenetic diversification patterns. These results suggest that variation in the absolute rate of lineage turnover through time, in conjunction with phylogenetically nonrandom extinction, may underlie the apparent diversity-dependent speciation observed in molecular phylogenies.},

	abstract = {Modern whales are frequently described as an adaptive radiation spurred by either the evolution of various key innovations (such as baleen or echolocation) or ecological opportunity following the demise of archaic whales. Recent analyses of diversification rate shifts on molecular phylogenies raise doubts about this interpretation since they find no evidence of increased speciation rates during the early evolution of modern taxa. However, one of the central predictions of ecological adaptive radiation is rapid phenotypic diversification, and the tempo of phenotypic evolution has yet to be quantified in cetaceans. Using a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of extant cetaceans and a morphological dataset on size, we find evidence that cetacean lineages partitioned size niches early in the evolutionary history of neocetes and that changes in cetacean size are consistent with shifts in dietary strategy. We conclude that the signature of adaptive radiations may be retained within morphological traits even after equilibrium diversity has been reached and high extinction or fluctuations in net diversification have erased any signature of an early burst of diversification in the structure of the phylogeny.},

It is less clear whether diversification of ancient clades spanning entire continents is consistent with adaptive radiation. We used novel fossil calibrations to generate a chronogram of Neotropical cichlid fishes and to test whether patterns of lineage and morphological diversification are congruent with hypothesized adaptive radiations in South and Central America. We found that diversification in the Neotropical cichlid clade and the highly diverse tribe Geophagini was consistent with diversity-dependent, early bursts of divergence followed by decreased rates of lineage accumulation. South American Geophagini underwent early rapid differentiation in body shape, expanding into novel morphological space characterized by elongate-bodied predators. Divergence in head shape attributes associated with trophic specialization evolved under strong adaptive constraints in all Neotropical cichlid clades. The South American Cichlasomatini followed patterns consistent with constant rates of morphological divergence. Although morphological diversification in South American Heroini was limited, Eocene invasion of Central American habitats was followed by convergent diversification mirroring variation observed in Geophagini. Diversification in Neotropical cichlids was influenced by the early adaptive radiation of Geophagini, which potentially limited differentiation in other cichlid clades.},

	abstract = {The use of the independent contrast method in comparative tests is studied. It is assumed that: (i) the traits under investigation are subject to natural selection; (ii) closely related species are similar because they share many characteristics of their niche, inherited from a common ancestor; and (iii) the current adaptive significance of the traits is the focus of investigation. The main objection to the use of species values in this case is that third variables which are shared by closely related species confound the relationship between the focal traits. In this paper, I argue that third variables are largely not controlled by the contrast methods, which are designed to estimate correlated evolution. To the extent that third variables also show correlated evolution, the true relationship among the traits of interest will remain obscured. Although the independent contrast method does not resolve the influence of third traits it does, in principle, provide a greater resolution than the use of the species mean values. However, its validity depends on the applicability of an evolutionary model which has a substantial stochastic component. To illustrate the consequences of relaxing this assumption I consider an alternative model on an adaptive radiation, where species come to fill a fixed niche space. Under this model, the expected value for the contrast correlation differs from that for the species correlation. The two correlations differ because contrasts reflect the historical pattern of diversification among species, whereas the species values describe the present–day relationships among the species. If the latter is of interest, I suggest that assessing significance based on the species correlations can be justified, providing that attention is paid to the role of potentially confounding third traits. Often, differences between contrast and species correlations may be biologically informative, reflecting changes in correlations between traits as an adaptive radiation proceeds; contrasts may be particularly useful as a means of investigating past history, rather than current utility of traits.},

These two observations are in direct conflict as such selection should deplete genetic variation. Furthermore, the presence of genetic variation in a trait, and selection acting on that trait, is often not sufficient for the trait to respond to selection. Here, we bring together geometric perspectives on mutation, selection, and genetic variation and show how the perceived incompatibility between these two observations is a consequence of taking a trait-by-trait approach to the multivariate problem of genetic variation and selection. We conclude that the simultaneous presence of widespead genetic variation in, and strong selection on, individual traits indicates that substantial multivariate genetic constraints are likely to be present in natural populations.},

We provide analytical expressions for the local density and average trait values. A species can sustain faster environmental shifts, develop a wider range and greater local adaptation when spatial environmental variation is low (generating low migration load) and multitrait adaptive potential is high.
